TODO
There are few remaining issues which prevents a succesfull pass of all tests at least.

 * test_evp.test_verify_final still fails

 * test_rsa.test_x509_public_encrypt fails

 * test_evp contains two tests, which hangs an interpreter, fix why
   see tests/test_evp.py:113 for details
   the same apply for test_rsa

 * test_x509 is unfixed

 * rework underlying code of httpclient (HTTPSConnection) - it does use various quirks has
   been removed in python3
   BTW: does import ssl means a (re)initialization of OpenSSL? How safe is to
   mix python.ssl with M2Crypto
